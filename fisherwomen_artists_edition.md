## _Fisherwomen_ by Craig Easton

__Strictly limited to 50 editions__, this twenty-four page portfolio comes in a bespoke embossed hard case along with with an original 12&quot; &times; 16&quot; print of _The hands that gut the herring_ and a signed & numbered certificate of authenticity.

Easton’s work is held in museum collections, archives and  private collections internationally. _**The hands that gut the herring**_ beautifully produced on Canson _Baryta Prestige_ paper, is made to the same exacting standards as the much larger exhibition prints in the _Fisherwomen_ series and is an opportunity to purchase an original print for a fraction of the cost of the larger prints.

This is the only print from this series made in this size and is only available as part of the  _Artists Edition_ of fifty.

As with the _Portfolio Edition_, the Artists Edition comes with _Fisherwomen & Photography_, a specially commissioned A5 four page insert written by Rachel Nordstrum, Photographic Collections Manager at the University of St Andrews.
