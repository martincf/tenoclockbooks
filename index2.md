## _Fisherwomen_ by Craig Easton

__A twenty-four page 11&quot; &times; 15&quot; portfolio publication__, _Fisherwomen_ showcases images from a long-term project exploring the traditional and contemporary importance of women to the fishing industry.

Following the historic route of the old herring fleet from Shetland to Great Yarmouth, the work presents intimate colour portraits of former and present-day fisherwomen alongside exquisite large format black & white landscapes. Personal testimonies weave a compelling tale in the history of British women at work.
