<h3><img src="/assets/images/hero_fisherwomen.jpg" alt="Fisherwomen" /></h3>

<p><strong>A twenty-four page 11" × 15" portfolio publication</strong>, Craig Easton’s <em>Fisherwomen</em> showcases images from a long-term project exploring the traditional and contemporary importance of women to the fishing industry.</p>

<p>Following the historic route of the old herring fleet from Shetland to Great Yarmouth, the work presents intimate colour portraits of former and present-day fisherwomen alongside exquisite large format black &amp; white landscapes. Combined with personal testimonies, the photographs weave a compelling tale of a unique phenomenon in the history of British women at work.</p>
