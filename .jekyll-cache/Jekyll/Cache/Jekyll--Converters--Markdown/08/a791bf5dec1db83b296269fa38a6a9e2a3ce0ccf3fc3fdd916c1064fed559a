<p><strong>A twenty-four page 11" Ã— 15" portfolio publication</strong>, Fisherwomen showcases images from a long-term project exploring the traditional and contemporary importance of women to the fishing industry.</p>

<p>Following the historic route of the old herring fleet from Shetland to Great Yarmouth, the work presents intimate colour portraits of former and present-day fisherwomen alongside exquisite large format black &amp; white landscapes. Personal testimonies weave a compelling tale in the history of British women at work.</p>
