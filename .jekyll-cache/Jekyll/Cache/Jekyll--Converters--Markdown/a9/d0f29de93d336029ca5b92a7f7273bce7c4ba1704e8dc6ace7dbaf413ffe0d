<p><strong>A twenty-four page 11" Ã— 15" portfolio publication</strong>, <em>Fisherwomen</em> showcases images from a long-term project exploring the traditional and contemporary importance of women to the fishing industry.</p>

<p>Following the historic route of the old herring fleet from Shetland to Great Yarmouth, the work presents intimate colour portraits of former and present-day fisherwomen alongside exquisite large format black &amp; white landscapes. Combined with personal testimonies, theÂ photographs weave a compelling tale of a unique phenomenon in the history of British women at work.</p>

<p>All editions come with <em>Fisherwomen &amp; Photography</em>, an A5 four page insert written by Rachel Nordstrum, Photographic Collections Manager at the University of St Andrews.</p>
