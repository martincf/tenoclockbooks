## _Fisherwomen_ by Craig Easton

__A twenty-four page 11&quot; &times; 15&quot; portfolio publication__, Fisherwomen is both an exploration and a celebration of the long tradition of women in fishing, presented in three parts: _Contemporary Portraits_, _Heritage_ and _Journey_.

This bespoke portfolio made on _Mohawk Superfine_ paper is presented in large format to showcase the exquisite detail and the emotional connection that Easton has captured with his 10 &times; 8 camera. The pictures are married with transcribed conversations outlining the extraordinary stories that the fisherwomen have to tell.

Limited edition of 500, each individually signed and numbered by the artist.

Each copy comes with _Fisherwomen & Photography_, a specially commissioned A5 four page insert written by Rachel Nordstrum, Photographic Collections Manager at the University of St Andrews.
